            Traditional ledgers are used in business for keeping day-to-day accounting information, the same way in blockchain distributed ledgers store all the transactions in all the peers that are part of the network. Any alteration in the ledger leads to an update in all the consecutive nodes. Voterâ€™s information, votes cast by voters are recorded and replicated on every ledger.
